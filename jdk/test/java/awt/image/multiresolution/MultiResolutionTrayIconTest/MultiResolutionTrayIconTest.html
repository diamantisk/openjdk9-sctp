<applet code="MultiResolutionTrayIconTest.class" width=100 height=30></applet>

To run test please push "Start" (if system tray is not supported, push "Pass").

Two tray icons will appear (note: sometimes they can go to the tray icons pool).

Please check if both of them have correct size and
the same colouring (white rectagle in a blue mount). In this case please push "Pass".

Otherwise (if the 2nd red-white small icon appears) please push "Fail".
