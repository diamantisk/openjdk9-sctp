/**
 * The configuration that is the result of resolution or resolution with
 * service binding.
 *
 * <h2><a name="resolution">Resolution</a></h2>
 *
 * <p> Resolution is the process of computing the transitive closure of a set
 * of root modules over a set of observable modules by resolving the
 * dependences expressed by {@code requires} clauses.
 *
 * The <em>dependence graph</em> is augmented with edges that take account of
 * implicitly declared dependences ({@code requires public}) to create a
 * <em>readability graph</em>. A {@code Configuration} encapsulates the
 * resulting graph of {@link ResolvedModule resolved modules}.
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { requires m2; }
 *     module m2 { requires public m3; }
 *     module m3 { }
 *     module m4 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If the module {@code m1} is resolved then the resulting configuration
 * contains three modules ({@code m1}, {@code m2}, {@code m3}). The edges in
 * its readability graph are: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2  (meaning m1 reads m2)
 *     m1 --> m3
 *     m2 --> m3
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> Resolution is an additive process. When computing the transitive closure
 * then the dependence relation may include dependences on modules in parent
 * configurations. The result is a <em>relative configuration</em> that is
 * relative to a parent configuration and where the readability graph may have
 * edges from modules in the configuration to modules in a parent configuration.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { requires m2; requires java.xml; }
 *     module m2 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If module {@code m1} is resolved with the configuration for the {@link
 * java.lang.reflect.Layer#boot() boot} layer as the parent then the resulting
 * configuration contains two modules ({@code m1}, {@code m2}). The edges in
 * its readability graph are:
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2
 *     m1 --> java.xml
 * } </pre>
 * where module {@code java.xml} is in the parent configuration. For
 * simplicity, this example omits the implicitly declared dependence on the
 * {@code java.base} module.
 *
 * <a name="automaticmoduleresolution"></a>
 * <p> {@link ModuleDescriptor#isAutomatic() Automatic} modules receive special
 * treatment during resolution. Each automatic module is resolved so that it
 * reads all other modules in the configuration and all parent configurations.
 * Each automatic module is also resolved as if it {@code requires public} all
 * other automatic modules in the configuration (and all automatic modules in
 * parent configurations). </p>

 * <h2><a name="servicebinding">Service binding</a></h2>
 *
 * <p> Service binding is the process of augmenting a graph of resolved modules
 * from the set of observable modules induced by the service-use dependence
 * ({@code uses} and {@code provides} clauses). Any module that was not
 * previously in the graph requires resolution to compute its transitive
 * closure. Service binding is an iterative process in that adding a module
 * that satisfies some service-use dependence may introduce new service-use
 * dependences. </p>
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { exports p; uses p.S; }
 *     module m2 { requires m1; provides p.S with p2.S2; }
 *     module m3 { requires m1; requires m4; provides p.S with p3.S3; }
 *     module m4 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If the module {@code m1} is resolved then the resulting graph of modules
 * has one module ({@code m1}). If the graph is augmented with modules induced
 * by the service-use dependence relation then the configuration will contain
 * four modules ({@code m1}, {@code m2}, {@code m3}, {@code m4}). The edges in
 * its readability graph are: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m2 --> m1
 *     m3 --> m1
 *     m3 --> m4
 * } </pre>
 * <p> The edges in the conceptual service-use graph are: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2  (meaning m1 uses a service that is provided by m2)
 *     m1 --> m3
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If this configuration is instantiated as a {@code Layer}, and if code in
 * module {@code m1} uses {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader} to
 * iterate over implementations of {@code p.S.class}, then it will iterate over
 * an instance of {@code p2.S2} and {@code p3.S3}. </p>
 *
 * <h3> Example </h3>
 *
 * <p> The following example uses the {@code resolveRequires} method to resolve
 * a module named <em>myapp</em> with the configuration for the boot layer as
 * the parent configuration. It prints the name of each resolved module and
 * the names of the modules that each module reads. </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *    ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);
 *
 *    Configuration parent = Layer.boot().configuration();
 *
 *    Configuration cf = parent.resolveRequires(finder,
 *                                              ModuleFinder.of(),
 *                                              Set.of("myapp"));
 *    cf.modules().forEach(m -> {
 *        System.out.format("%s -> %s%n",
 *            m.name(),
 *            m.reads().stream()
 *                .map(ResolvedModule::name)
 *                .collect(Collectors.joining(", ")));
 *    });
 * }</pre>

     *     descriptor ({@code module-info.class}) or two versions of the same
     *     module are found in the same directory. </p></li>
     *
     *     <li><p> A cycle is detected, say where module {@code m1} requires
     *     module {@code m2} and {@code m2} requires {@code m1}. </p></li>
     *
     *     <li><p> Two or more modules in the configuration export the same
     *     package to a module that reads both. This includes the case where a
     *     module {@code M} containing package {@code p} reads another module
     *     that exports {@code p} to {@code M}. </p></li>
     *
     *     <li><p> A module {@code M} declares that it "{@code uses p.S}" or
     *     "{@code provides p.S with ...}" but package {@code p} is neither in
     *     module {@code M} nor exported to {@code M} by any module that
     *     {@code M} reads. </p></li>
     *
